"""Pre-registered F0 / FT-NOTE / FT-SOLUTION MMMU-val proof: merged export, 8k run wrapper, preregistration, analysis, gate.

Nothing here trains or selects. ``run-eval`` only registers the statistical variant IDs (three 8k, one b2) inside
its own process and then calls the unchanged scripts/eval.sh entry point; src/ is never edited.
The 8k statistical (paired F0/FT) variants differ from mmmu-val-v8 only in seed, 32 slots (the configs' batch_size; a
run executes MMDL_EVAL_SLOTS slots, see ``resolve_slots``), an 8192-token output cap, the image budget 262144..1310720 pixels (an evaluation budget, not the RL training budget) and a 24576
context. The c16 variant files stay on disk but are not registered.
Scope: every preregistered run is a ``--mode partial`` run on one of two subsets of the 900 MMMU-val items, both
derived from the frozen B2 + team-final-answer-v8 baseline and bound by sha256 in the preregistration
(evaluation only, never training): "wrong" = the 342 items B2 got wrong (proof-eval-subset-v1) and "rest" = the
558 items B2 got right (proof-eval-subset-rest-v1). ``make-subset --kind {wrong,rest}`` writes either file.
The course run (mmmu-val-v8, 900 items, plain scripts/eval.sh) keeps its code path but is not preregistered.
Arms: F0 (untrained base), FT-NOTE (primary, fixed in advance) and FT-SOLUTION (comparison); each has exactly one
checkpoint. ``analyze`` re-scores preserved raw responses with the frozen V8 scorer (the only scorer here) and
reduces several seeds only as means (CLAUDE.md §2.8): no reducer argument, no repeated (arm, variant, subset) run,
no per-item seed choice, no best seed. ``gate`` applies the preregistered 300-item decision rule to the "wrong"
subset; it is a threshold for spending more, not proof of improvement.
Error-note version 2 (claudedocs/plan_self_note_v2_20261102.md section 1): ``preregister --format v4`` writes a
separate preregistration (format notebook-rl-proof-prereg-v4) with arms F0 and FT-V2 on the existing
mmmu-val-v8-8k-seed3407-v2 variant, wrong + rest subsets (900 items). ``gate-62`` passes iff the FT-V2 900-item V8
correct count of that one seed exceeds B2's 558; one run, so not proof of improvement.
Error-note version 3 uses ``preregister --format v5 --ft-v3-model-ref REF``: one declared FT-NOTE-V3 checkpoint,
seed 3407 and the same 8k variant, wrong + rest exactly once. ``gate-62`` checks >=559; ``gate-67.4`` checks >=607.
Error-note version 4 (RL + note SFT) uses ``preregister --format v6 --ft-v4-model-ref REF`` the same way with the one
final FT-HYB-V4 export of its last round (``verify-v4-export`` before ledger START).
The single-response RL+SFT campaign (error_note.single_campaign) uses ``preregister --format v7 --ft-single-model-ref REF``:
one final FT-SINGLE export, same variant/seed/subsets, PASS iff > 558 (``gate-62``); ``export`` and
``verify-single-export`` take the campaign's sealed campaign-plan.json as ``--binding``.
``--format v8`` (user 2026-11-06) is v7 with one 900-item run per arm on the B2-condition variant
mmmu-val-v8-b2-seed3407-v1 (FINAL_VARIANT_V8: mmmu-val-v8 with 32 config slots; 32768 output tokens,
1003520..4014080 pixels, 40960 context), registered by ``run-eval`` like the 8k variants (VARIANT_LIMITS).
Only F0 runs with the same evaluation code, registration and hardware are paired; historical counts are display only.
``--format v9`` (user 2026-11-13) is v8 in two stages over the halves of ``make-subset --kind half-a|half-b`` (per
subject, 15 of 30 IDs by sha256("mmmu-screen-v1:" + id); IDs only): half-a first; ``ledger-start --subset half-b``
is refused unless ``gate-screen`` (the arm's finished half-a run, validated by ``analyze`` over the whole ledger)
reaches the preregistered screen_gate minimum_correct (stored B2 V8 correct count on half-a + 6). Otherwise the
evaluation stops: the half-a count is the result and no 900-item count exists.
``--format v10`` (user 2026-11-14, v15) is v9 for a v15 export (rollout_adapter vllm-lora-unmerged+vision-hooks): nothing
is merged; ``registered_variants`` serves its LLM adapter through vLLM 0.11.0 LoRA and its vision adapter through exact
forward hooks (fine_tuning.error_note.llm_lora) on the in-process continuous engine, kind ``unmerged-lora``. Other kinds
run exactly the v14 code. v7-v9 refuse a v15 export and v10 refuses a merged one.

Run ledger (append-only JSONL, hash-chained, fsynced): ``ledger-start --prereg P --arm A --variant V --subset S
--run-id R --ledger L`` must precede every evaluation run (``run-eval`` or the plain course ``scripts/eval.sh``; R is
the run directory name artifact_root/runs/R). It refuses a second start of the same (arm, variant, subset) unless
the first is recorded with ``ledger-fail --ledger L --run-id R --reason ...`` (refused for a finished run).
``analyze``/``gate`` take every run directory of the ledger: they refuse a run that was never started, started under
another (arm, variant, subset) or recorded FAILED, and any live started run that is not passed (an omitted or
replaced run). A passed run that is not finished is listed as unfinished and left out of the numbers.
